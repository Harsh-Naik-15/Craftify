                <h4>Wood Basics</h4>
                <p>Early builders learned by trial and error which wood species to use and which wood from trees grown in certain locations and under certain conditions was stronger, more easily worked—or finer grained—than wood from other locations. White oak, for example, is tough, strong, and durable, which made it a prized choice for shipbuilding, bridges, barn timbers, fence posts, and flooring. Woods such as black walnut and cherry, on the other hand, were primarily valued as cabinet woods. Hickory was made into tough, resilient tool handles. Black locust was prized for barn timbers and trunnels (or “treenails”—the stout pegs used for joining timber frames). Modern research—much of it performed by the Forest Products Laboratory and through wood research programs at a handful of universities worldwide—has substantiated that location and growth conditions significantly affect wood properties and has given us the means to understand and predict wood performance.

                    Softwoods vs. Hardwoods
                    The differentiation of softwood and hardwood stems from the difference in two broad classes of trees defined by how they reproduce. The softwoods we use for building in the U.S. come mostly from conifers—the needle-leaved evergreen trees, such as pine, spruce, and fir. In botanical terms these trees are gymnosperms, which produce “naked” seeds in cones. Hardwoods come from angiosperms—flowering trees that produce seeds covered by a protective fruit of some sort (nuts, acorns, and samaras—aka "keys," such as those from maple trees—are all fruits). The hardwood trees used for building are typically broad-leafed, deciduous trees, such as maple, birch, and oak.
                    
                    Softwoods and hardwoods have very different component cells. Softwoods have a simpler, basic structure with only two cell types and relatively little variation in structure within these cell types. Hardwoods have greater structural complexity with both a greater number of cell types and great variability within the cell types.</p>

                <h4>What to Look For in Exterior Wood Finishes</h4>
                <p>The choice of exterior wood finishes is dependent on the manner in which it will be used.
    
                    All-acrylic latex paints are the most durable house paints, but oil-based paint films usually provide the best protection from water and water vapor.  Although latex paints allow water to pass through more readily, they adhere better when wood swells and shrinks.
                        
                    High-gloss paints last longer than low-gloss paints, because they contain more paint resin and less pigment.  Solid-color stains are best for textured or rough-sawn lumber, and over existing paints.
                        
                    Water-repellent preservatives prevent warping and checking.  Water-repellent preservatives that are paintable decrease the shrinking and swelling of wood by preventing dew and rain from penetrating the wood.
                        
                    Semi-transparent stains that are oil or alkyd-based won’t hide the wood grain or trap moisture in the wood, thus the stains won’t blister or peel.  The best solvent-borne penetrating stains contain a fungicide, protection from ultraviolet radiation, and a water repellent.</p>

                <h4>How to Repair Your Wood Siding</h4>
                <p>Wood siding, for all of its classic elegance and historical significance, can require a lot of upkeep. Beyond the usual scraping and painting, there will be times when it needs a little more than just a fresh coat to hide its blemishes. The good news is that regardless of the type of wood or style of board – even shingled siding, the methods are similar.

                    First, depending on the nature of the damage, you should determine the cause and fix that before attempting your repair. For example, if leaky gutters or bad downspouts are the reason, those issues should be addressed before repairing the damaged wood.If the wood is cracked or dented, then some filler and sanding may be all you need prior to painting. If there is a split or worse, all is not lost. The boards can be replaced with relative ease.
                    
                    Each board is held in place by nails driven through the course above it. Try only to remove what is necessary. If a window, corner or doorway is close enough, it generally looks better if you remove all the way to that point thus avoiding unwanted seams.
                    
                    To remove a damaged board, work a chisel or flat bar along the bottom edge of the piece in question. Take care not to damage the surrounding pieces. If nails pull out along with the board while it is pried up, pinch the nail with pliers or a pry bar and push back down on the board until the nail head pops out. Remove the nails. If the nails aren’t accessible from the front, slide a hacksaw blade behind the board and cut the nail. Try not to scrape the surrounding pieces of wood.</p>

                <h4>How to Pour Footings for a Deck</h4>
                <p>Taking your time and pouring footings properly will give your deck a more stable, durable base for many years of enjoyable use. To pour footings…
                    Determine the necessary size for the footings and plan for adequate materials, including enough concrete, gravel, and footing forms.
                    Dig holes slightly deeper than necessary. You can dig by hand or use a power auger for faster, more even holes. The overall depth will vary based on your local conditions.
                    Add several inches of gravel to the base of the hole and tamp it down to provide a secure base for the bottom of the footing.
                    Place the footing form or tube into the hole, and backfill the hole with dirt to keep the form level and even.
                    Fill the tube with concrete, tamping the concrete when half-full to remove air pockets and ensure a firmer structure. When filling the remainder of the tube, overfill it slightly.
                    Level the top of the concrete and set the post holder firmly in place. Tamp it lightly to ensure a secure bond, and check that it is still centered and level on the footing.
                    Allow the footing to cure thoroughly before adding weight to the structure. Curing time can vary from 24-72 hours depending on the concrete type, footing sizes, and local conditions.
                    It can take several hours or days to pour enough footings for your deck, and it can be easier to work with a partner, especially when handling different pieces of equipment or moving heavy concrete. Taking your time and doing this step properly, however, will ensure superior support for your deck</p>

                <h4>4 Tips for Complex Roofing Projects</h4>
                <p>The challenges that accompany every remodeling project are multiplied when it comes to homeowner association remodels. And when working on projects of immense size, the stakes are high for both contractors and residents. 

                    La Rocque Better Roofs, a contractor serving southern California for nearly 40 years, draws 80% of its business from projects involving homeowner associations, which require all the moving parts of a single-family home renovation, but on a much more extensive scale. Last year, the company took on a re-roofing project that involved 185 units along with a clubhouse, standalone garage, and park restroom building—resulting in the need for 250,000 square feet of shingles across the property. The following are La Rocque’s top four tips for successfully completing such complex, expansive projects.</p>
